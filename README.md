# caulk-dev
Linkable vector commitments and lookup tables.

WARNING:  This project contains a proof of concept implementation of Caulk that has not received any formal audit.  It should not be used production.

This project contains sample SRS and Q-openings (for a sample poly) for various N up to 2^12. If SRS and/or openings don't exist they are recreated (this is timely!).

SRS and openings for bigger N (up to 2^20) can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANrNC-aIW22Z6Kx8vrea21Abl2q52hQH/view?usp=sharing).
The folders `polys` and `srs` in the archive should be merged with their counterparts in this project.
